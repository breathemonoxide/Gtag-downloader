# FAQ

Can you add multiplayer?

We could but it would make GTAG downloader too similar to the project "GT patcher".

Will there be a linux release?

We would love to make one and have plans to do so in the near future.

Why does it ask for my steam credidentials?

This is to verify that you own Gorilla Tag before you download any builds as without this GTAG downloader would be illegal. No credentials go to us or depotdownloader but go straight to steam.

Why are there only historical Quest builds?

This is because honestly we dont know how quest auth would work so you can just have historical for now.

When will GTAG downloader be out of pre-release

Hopefully by the end of November 2024 but you can still download pre-release versions
